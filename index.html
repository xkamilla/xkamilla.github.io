              <p>Our school had two tracks of which I chose the programming track. During my studies I was introduced to many programming languages, tools and project management methods. Examples include C#, JavaScript, SQL for programming languages, Visual Studio, Unity3D, Github for tools and Scrum and RUP for project management. I also participated in school projects in which my roles varied from database handler to game programmer.</p>
              <p>For my thesis I chose the subject of user interfaces in Adventure Games. In this thesis I cover designing user interfaces in general and from adventure video games' point of view. I also researched a few game engines and presented their possibilities for making a user interface. The reasons for the choice of topic are my interest in user interfaces and my fondness for adventure video games. I also developed a small demo game in which I present some of the UI design choices. The thesis got the grade of 4/5 and can be found <a href="http://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:amk-2018061413821">here</a>.

              <p>At Joensuu Co-op I was assigned as the fifth member of a trainee team, and we were given a task of creating a game in two months. Three of the team members specialized in graphics and 3D-modeling and had next to none programming skills, so I assumed the role of lead programmer, as I was the only full-time programmer. Our fourth member had other projects, so he was more of a half-time member, but he had more programming experience, so he helped me out by giving second opinions and other helpful advice. Together we created a scrolling space shooter game which has three levels and a final boss.</p>
              <p>At Joensuu Co-op I learned to work in a team and got to know how it feels to have a leading role in programming. Even though our work was quite free, we assumed Scrum as our main project management method. Our developing tools included Unity3D, Blender and Github. We were monitored by one of Joensuu Games Co-op's executives.</p>

              <p>Kolibri Studios Oy is a one-man game company located in Hyvinkää. I was taken in as a trainee, because the company was developing a bigger project, a game called Land Crashers. My work included writing and providing code for Kolibri Studios, which was mostly included in the Land Crashers project. Examples of my work include base enemy AI, dog AI, building's healthbars and displaying them, as well as the player's attack, etc.</p>
              <p>I worked remotely and contacted Kolibri Studios at least twice a week and when I had completed my tasks. As Kolibri Studios Oy is a very small company, it wasn't deemed necessary by my employer to use a project management method. Our main tools were GameMaker Studio, and we used email and Facebook for communication. My time at Kolibri Studios was very enjoyable, and my employer was so happy with me he suggested I stayed the whole five months of the school internship instead of the three that we agreed on preliminarily.</p>

              <p>Project for Karelia University of Applied Sciences' library, Pisara. The goal was to develop a game which would introduce new students to the school library's services as well as the process of writing a thesis. Making this game had been a thesis subject for another student and our team's task was to develop it further. We ended up rebuilding the game from scratch because it needed to be browser based. Our time was cut short so the project was given to students in the next course for further development. The main tools for our project were Unity, C# and Jira.</p>

              <p>My first team project which was about designing and developing a cottage reservation system. This system included an UI for the customers, employees and administrator as well as a database for storing the reservation data. My role was to design and handle he database with a partner. The tools used in this project were Visual Studio 2015, MySQL workbench, SQL and Trello.</p>
